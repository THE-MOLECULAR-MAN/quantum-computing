[Groverâ€™s algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605043) was the first to demonstrate this speedup on unstructured search problems. Formulating a Grover's search problem requires an oracle function that marks one or more computational basis states as the states we are interested in finding, and an amplification circuit that increases the amplitude of marked states, consequently suppressing the remaining states.\n","\n","Here, we demonstrate how to construct Grover oracles and use the `GroverOperator` from the Qiskit circuit library to easily set up a Grover's search instance. The runtime `Sampler` primitive allows seamless execution of Grover circuits, including automatic compilation, error suppression, and readout error mitigation techniques.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"032bc357","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# create virtual environment and install dependencies\n","! source ./.venv/bin/activate || python3 -m venv ./.venv && source ./.venv/bin/activate\n","! pip3 install --quiet --upgrade pip\n","! pip install  -r requirements.txt"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"54602708","metadata":{},"source":["## Setup\n","\n","Here we import the small number of tools we need for this tutorial.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e2cb0472","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Built-in modules\n","import math\n","\n","# Imports from Qiskit\n","from qiskit import QuantumCircuit\n","from qiskit.circuit.library import GroverOperator, MCMT, ZGate\n","from qiskit.visualization import plot_distribution\n","\n","# Imports from Qiskit Runtime\n","from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Sampler, Batch"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8668ab00","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# To run on hardware, select the backend with the fewest number of jobs in the queue\n","service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel=\"ibm_quantum\")\n","backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)\n","backend.name"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d4845f4d","metadata":{},"source":["## Step 1: Map classical inputs to a quantum problem\n","\n","Grover's algorithm requires an [oracle](https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/grovers-algorithm) that specifies one or more marked computational basis states, where \"marked\" means a state with a phase of -1.  A controlled-Z gate, or its multi-controlled generalization over $N$ qubits, marks the $2^{N}-1$ state (`'1'`\\*$N$ bit-string).  Marking basis states with one or more `'0'` in the binary representation requires applying X-gates on the corresponding qubits before and after the controlled-Z gate; equivalent to having an open-control on that qubit.  In the following code, we define an oracle that does just that, marking one or more input basis states defined through their bit-string representation.
